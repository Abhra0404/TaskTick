# TaskTick ⏱️

A sleek, web-based time-management tool that supports a **Timer**, **Stopwatch**, and **Pomodoro** mode to help you stay focused and productive.

## 🚀 Features

- **Timer**: Set a countdown in hours, minutes, seconds and track completed sessions.  
- **Stopwatch**: Track elapsed time with start/pause/reset controls.  
- **Pomodoro**: Use work/break cycles (default 25 min work + 5 min break) with session count tracking.  
- **History log**: See how many timers have been completed and track your productivity.  
- Responsive UI built for everyday use.

## 🎯 Why use TaskTick?

Whether you’re prepping for a software engineering role (yes, I’m looking at you, Google-aspiring kaizenX), in a study session, or just trying to manage tasks better — TaskTick gives you a flexible, distraction-free timer setup.

## 🧪 Getting Started

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhra0404/TaskTick.git
cd TaskTick
````

### Run locally

Simply open `index.html` in your browser.
No server setup needed — one file to rule them all.

### Customize

* Change default Pomodoro durations in the JS file (e.g. `"workTime": 1500` for 25 min).
* Style edits: tweak `style.css` to match your theme.
* Add new features: session alarms, dark mode, export logs — sky’s the limit.

## 💡 Ideas for Next Steps

* Add **dark/light theme toggle**
* Persist history using `localStorage` so it remains between sessions
* Allow user-custom durations for Pomodoro (e.g., 45/15)
* Add **notifications** when timers complete
* Integrate with task lists or to-do apps (your full-stack web dev goal inching closer!)
